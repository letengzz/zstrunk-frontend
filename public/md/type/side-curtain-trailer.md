## Types of Side Curtain Trailer 

The side curtain trailers produced by our company mainly include the following types: 

**3 Axle Curtain Side Trailer**

The side curtains and top curtain of the side curtain trailer can be fully opened, allowing forklifts to carry out loading and unloading operations simultaneously from multiple directions. The operating width is greatly increased. For less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation, the unloading sequence is not restricted.

**40 Tons Curtain Sider**

The interior space of the carriage is open and regular, without too many internal structural obstructions. The layout can be flexibly adjusted according to the shape and size of the goods. Whether it is large mechanical equipment, bundled pipes, or pallet goods of various specifications, they can all be easily loaded.

## Advantages of Side Curtain Trailer

**Excellent flexibility for loading and unloading**

Firstly, curtainsiders provide considerably enhanced flexibility for loading and unloading goods, ensuring that processes are as efficient as possible. As the side curtains of the trailer can be retracted with ease, this means that there is easy access from the side or from the back, which enables quick, seamless loading and unloading, helping to save time. Whilst with some trailers, a loading dock is a necessity, a further benefit of this flexibility is that loading bays are not always required. Goods can be loaded onto the trailer by ramp, forklift, or other means of safe lifting equipment.

**Improved safety and protection**

Secondly, curtainside trailers offer improved safety compared to flatbed trailers. With the ability to cover and contain the load, curtainside trailers eliminate the need for time-consuming and hazardous tarping processes. This reduces the risk of accidents and injuries during transportation, creating a safer work environment for drivers and workers involved in the loading and unloading processes. Trailer side curtains also provide security to hide cargo during transit, and act as a barrier against all elements, including rain, snow, sleet, wind and sunlight, preventing damage to the cargo.

**Greater flexibility of deliveries**

Another important benefit is that side curtain trailers allow for simplified partial deliveries, allowing for various consignments to be loaded and transported in one journey, saving fuel and helping to reduce CO2 emissions. With the ability to open rear doors or retract the side curtains, goods can be loaded in such a way that parts of the cargo can easily be unloaded at one location without the need to unload the entire trailer and then reload with goods that have not yet reached their destination. This flexibility helps considerably improve overall efficiency of logistics.

## Applications of Side Curtain Trailer 

1. **Beverage and Food Industries**

   The food and beverage industry often require rapid distribution methods. Curtain side trailers are ideal for transporting cases of drinks, pallets of perishable goods, or food items, enabling quick access and protection during transit.

2. **Building Materials**

   Transporting heavy or bulky building materials is another common application. The wide access allows for easy loading of large items like lumber or insulation, while the weather-protective curtains ensure that materials arrive in optimal condition.

3. **Retail and Merchandise**

   In retail, timely deliveries of merchandise are crucial. Curtain side trailers enhance the speed of loading and unloading goods in warehouses and retail locations, supporting the just-in-time delivery models prevalent in the retail sector.

4. **Machinery Transport**

   Manufacturers of machinery often rely on curtain side trailers to transport large equipment. The versatility of the curtain access allows for customized loading arrangements, accommodating diverse shapes and sizes.

## The Correct Procedure for Opening or Closing Curtain-Side Trailer Curtains

1. **Open The Curtains**

   - Always wear safety gloves (the best way to prevent hand injuries).


   - Release tensioner at one end. Undo buckle nearest end pole, then release and remove end pole.

   - Remove the rest buckles in order. During this process, you need to keep your body completely behind the fastened buckle to prevent being injured by the falling load.

   - Using two hands, release the foot of the free pole.

   - Go to the end, grab the two curtain buckles and pull back. Don’t try to slide the entire curtain at once, do it in sections.

2. **Securing The Curtain**

   - Always wear safety gloves

   - Fix one end of the curtain, and then close the pole to the other end.

   - Fix the free rod to the tensioner.

   - Wrap the tensioner upwards until it is tight between the curtain and the end rod.

   - Fasten all buckles.

## FAQ

Q: What are the characteristics of a curtain side truck?

A: A curtainsider trailer has sides covered by a fabric curtain. Flexible material is typically used, which offers many benefits over solid rigid walls. The curtain can be rolled up or moved aside to provide easy access to the trailer's interior. This makes it easier to load and unload cargo from the sides.

Q: How does a curtain side trailer work?

A: A curtainside trailer, or curtain van, is a dry van and a flatbed trailer combined into one trailer. It loads like a flatbed but protects like a van with a ceiling, front wall, and rear doors. The sides are open to allow access for loading, and the rear swing doors allow it to be dock loaded, similar to a dry van.

Q: What is the difference between curtain side and tautliner?

A: Tautliners, also known as curtainside trucks, are used to protect goods during transport while enabling efficient loading and unloading. While the name 'Tautliner' originally described a particular brand of vehicle, it has become a generic name used across much of the world.

Q: How do you measure for side curtains?

A: To measure for side panel width, simply measure the width you need the panels to cover, and order at exactly that width. For instance, if you'd like your panels to cover 24", enter 24” as your width. Side panels can also be collapsed to cover less space when desired.

Q: What is the most common flatbed trailer?

A: In addition to the dry van, the standard flatbed trailer is an incredibly common type of trailer. Although they come in several different sizes (including 24, 40, 45, 48 and 53 feet) the 48-foot flatbed trailer is the most frequently used. Versatility is a key feature of these trailers.

Q: How should a flatbed trailer be loaded?

A: A good rule of thumb is 60% toward the front and 40% toward the back. If you load too heavy in the back, the trailer will fishtail. If you load too heavy in the front of the trailer, there will be less weight on the front axle of the towing vehicle which can reduce traction and steering ability.
