## HOWO Tanker Truck Advanced Stability and Control Functions

1. **Electronic Stability Control (ESC):** This system helps the driver maintain vehicle stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction.ESC automatically applies the brakes to individual wheels, preventing sideslip and understeer and ensuring that the truck stays on its intended path.

2. **Traction Control System (TCS):** Monitors the speed of each wheel and intervenes when wheel slip is detected. By applying braking force to slipping wheels, TCS improves traction and helps maintain control over a variety of terrain. This is especially important in adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and ice.

3. **Automatic Traction Control (ATC):** Works in tandem with TCS to manage the transfer of power to the wheels, optimizing traction and preventing wheel slip during acceleration. This system is vital for maintaining control in slippery conditions and during rapid acceleration.

4. **Rollover Stability Control (RSC):** Detects potential rollover and automatically applies the brakes to slow down and prevent rollover. This system is particularly important for vehicles with a high center of gravity, such as heavy trucks.
