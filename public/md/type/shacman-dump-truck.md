  ##### Braking System of Shacman Dump Truck

  Driving Brake

  Pedal manipulation, dual circuit air brake. The maximum working pressure is 1MPa and the pressure regulating valve cutoff pressure is 1MPa. The first circuit acts on the rear axle (or double rear axle) wheels, and the second circuit acts on the front axle wheels. Once one of the two circuit drops below 0.55 MPa (5.5 bar), the air cylinder pressure indicator light is on. At this moment, park immediately and find out the cause of the pressure leak.

  Auxiliary Brake

  The auxiliary brake is controlled and operated by the button valve mounted on the floor in the left diagonal front of the driver in the cab. The traveling vehicle can execute auxiliary brake by the energy consumed by the engine. When driving down the long slope, the driver must use exhaust brake.

  Emergency and parking brake

  The manual brake can also be used as emergency brake or parking brake. It achieves its function by the energy storage spring brake cylinder of the rear axle (or double rear axles). The functions of parking brake are achieved by operating the manual brake valve handle.

  Trailer brake (optional device)

  The trailer brake valve is used for the brake of semi-trailer by slowly pulling backward the brake valve handle. It is a brake system independent of tractor.
