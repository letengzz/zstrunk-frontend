##  Types of Lowbed Semi Trailer

The lowbed semi trailers produced by our company mainly include the following types: 

1. **ixed Gooseneck Lowboy Trailer**

   The fixed gooseneck lowboy trailer (FGN) has a larger deck length and is lightweight. Because it is a lowboy, a FGN is low to the earth and usually includes drop ramps in the back for quick and easy equipment loading.

2. **Removable Gooseneck Lowboy Trailer**

   This trailer, also known as an RGN, has a shorter deck length. Not to be confused with a RGN, the difference between lowboy and RGN are essentially an RGN is a kind of lowboy. So, the capacity of the trailers is what separates them.

3. **Stretch Lowboy Trailers**

   A stretch double drop trailer is intended for oversized freight that is too long for a conventional step deck trailer due to length regulations. It also acts as a brace, preventing overhang. Loads up to 10 feet in height are permitted on the lower deck.

## Advantages of Lowbed Semi Trailer

**Enhanced Load Capacity**

Lowbed semi-trailers boast an exceptional load capacity, allowing them to transport heavier equipment that standard trailers can't handle. This enhanced capacity means businesses can move larger pieces of machinery, leading to increased operational efficiency.

**Lower Loading Height**

The design of lowbed trailers features a lower deck height, facilitating easier loading and unloading of heavy equipment. This design reduces the ramp angle, making it safer and more efficient to load equipment with greater stability.

**Increased Versatility**

Lowbed semi-trailers can transport a variety of loads, including construction equipment, oversized cargo, and other heavy items. This versatility makes them suitable for construction, mining, and transportation industries, allowing fleet managers to adapt to varying demands.

**Cost Efficiency**

Investing in lowbed semi-trailers can lead to long-term cost savings. They often require fewer trips due to their larger cargo capacity, which can significantly reduce fuel and labor costs. Moreover, their durability ensures a longer lifespan, further enhancing their cost-effectiveness.

## Applications of Lowbed Semi Trailer

**Construction**

Construction companies use these trailers to transport heavy construction equipment, such as excavators, bulldozers, cranes, and concrete mixers. The ability to transport these machines intact and securely is a significant advantage in the construction industry.

**Agriculture**

Farmers and agricultural businesses use these trailers to transport oversized farming equipment, including tractors, combine harvesters, and other machinery. This helps improve efficiency and productivity during planting and harvest seasons.

**Mining**

The mining industry often relies on these trailers to move heavy mining equipment, such as large trucks, excavators, and drills. These trailers play a crucial role in keeping mining operations running smoothly.

**Energy Sector**

These trailers are used to transport components of wind turbines, power plant equipment, and transformers in the energy sector. Specialized transport capabilities are essential in the development and maintenance of energy infrastructure.

**Transportation of Boats and Aircraft**

These trailers are often used for the transport of boats, yachts, and aircraft components. Their low clearance makes loading and unloading these oversized and valuable assets more manageable.

## Braking System Types for Lowbed Semi Trailers

**Drum Brakes**

Many low - bed semi - trailers are equipped with drum brakes. These brakes work by using a set of brake shoes that expand against the inner surface of a rotating drum attached to the axle. Drum brakes are reliable and provide good stopping power, helping to ensure the trailer can be brought to a stop safely without skidding or losing stability.

**Disc Brakes**

In some cases, disc brakes are used, especially on larger or more specialized low - bed semi - trailers. Disc brakes use a caliper that squeezes a brake pad against a rotating disc. They offer better heat dissipation and more consistent braking performance than drum brakes, which is important for maintaining stability during emergency stops or when descending long slopes.

**Anti - lock Braking System (ABS)**

Most modern low - bed semi - trailers are equipped with ABS. This system prevents the wheels from locking up during braking, allowing the driver to maintain steering control and preventing the trailer from skidding or jackknifing. ABS is particularly effective in wet or slippery road conditions, significantly enhancing the stability and safety of the trailer during transportation.

## Suspension System Types for Lowbed Semi Trailers

**Leaf Spring Suspension**

Many low - bed semi - trailers are equipped with leaf spring suspension systems. These systems consist of multiple layers of curved metal springs that are connected to the trailer's axle and frame. Leaf springs help to evenly distribute the load of the cargo across the axles, reducing the impact of bumps and vibrations on the trailer's stability. They also provide some flexibility, allowing the wheels to move independently to a certain extent, which helps the trailer maintain better contact with the road surface.

**Air Suspension**

Some higher - end low - bed semi - trailers use air suspension systems. Air - filled rubber bags are used instead of traditional springs. Air suspension offers several advantages for stability. It can automatically adjust the height of the trailer based on the load, keeping the deck at a consistent level. This is particularly useful when the load on the trailer changes during transportation. Additionally, air suspension provides better shock absorption, reducing the bouncing and swaying of the trailer, which improves overall stability.

## FAQ

Q: What are the structural features of a low bed semi trailer?

A: It usually adopts a concave beam or well type frame. The front section of the frame is a gooseneck, with the kingpin at the front of the gooseneck connecting to the fifth wheel coupling on the tractor, and the rear end of the gooseneck connecting to the semi trailer frame. The middle section is the cargo platform, which is the lowest part of the frame, and the rear section is the wheel frame with wheels.

Q: How is the cargo loaded onto a low bed semi trailer?

A: When loading construction machinery and equipment onto a low bed semi trailer, it is usually loaded from the rear of the semi trailer. This can be done by moving the machinery and equipment over the rear wheel frame or by removing the wheels first, and then securing the machinery and equipment on the semi trailer.

Q: What is the load bearing capacity range of low bed semi trailers?

A: The load bearing capacity varies depending on the number of axles and tire size. Generally, it is between 20 and 150 tons. On highways, six axle and above low bed semi trailers are limited to 49 tons.

Q: How to choose a suitable low bed semi trailer?

A: Consider factors such as the type of goods to be transported, the typical load weight, the transportation distance, and local regulations. Also, evaluate the reputation of the manufacturer, the quality of the trailer's components, and the availability of after sales service.

Q: What is the lifespan of a low bed semi trailer?

A: With proper maintenance, it can have a lifespan of 10 15 years or more. However, factors such as frequency of use, road conditions, and the quality of maintenance can significantly affect its lifespan.

Q: How often should a low bed semi trailer be maintained?

A: It should be inspected daily for any visible signs of damage. Major maintenance, including checking the brakes, suspension, and axles, should be carried out every 10,000 15,000 miles or as recommended by the manufacturer.
