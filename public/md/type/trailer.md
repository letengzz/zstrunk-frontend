## Advantages of Trailer 

1. **Versatility**

   These trailers have a lot of advantages, but one of the most important is one we’ve already mentioned—it’s basically the multitool of the trailer world. Even if all you’re buying it for is a consistent job where it will be doing the same work daily, it’s always good to future-proof. With a trailer, so long as you can secure your cargo and it doesn’t overtax your weight limits, you can haul just about anything.

2. **Lightweight**

   The simple design of a trailer isn’t just good for moving just about any cargo you can think of—it also cuts down on the material used in the trailer’s construction! These trailers don’t have complex mechanical systems or parts and there’s no roof or door, making utility models much lighter than many other trailer types. This is useful in a number of ways.

3. **Earn Money**

   Your trailer’s flexibility opens up far more potential job opportunities, allowing you to carry more types of cargo in more fields. You could even rent your trailer out to the neighborhood, giving friends, family, and neighbors the opportunity to make use of your multitool as well.

## Applications of Trailer

**1. Lawn Care Equipment**

Many people buy a trailer to haul equipment too big to fit in the back of a pickup truck. Needing to transport a lawn mower for contract work or private use is one of the most common reasons you could have for getting a trailer.

**2. Construction Materials**

Construction supplies and tools are large and heavy — you will have a much easier time using a trailer to haul materials to your project site than you would with a pickup truck. If you work as an independent contractor, having a trailer is a necessity.

**3. Furniture**

A trailer is a good piece of equipment for moving furniture. Most furniture is large and heavy, so loading pieces onto a trailer with the help of a ramp is easier than trying to cram them into your personal vehicle.

**4. Debris and Trash**

You can use your trailer to load scrap materials, waste, debris and transportation to a landfill or recycling plant. If you need to get rid of a high quantity of trash on a regular basis, your trailer will come in handy.

**5. Recreational Vehicles**

Your trailer is the perfect tool for transporting a recreational vehicle, whether you have an ATV, golf cart or dirt bike. You can easily load your vehicle onto the trailer using a ramp and haul it to your destination.

**6. Livestock**

You can set up a stock trailer to transport live animals, feed and water containers. You can use a bumper pull or gooseneck trailer for this purpose. The bumper pull trailer attaches to a hitch on the back of your vehicle, and the gooseneck attaches to the inside of the trunk’s bed.

**7. Scrap Metal and Recycling Materials**

Flatbed trailers are a popular choice for hauling scrap metal because they can transport unwieldy materials that fit poorly in a confined space. A heavy-duty trailer can transport old tires and other heavy recycling materials.

**8. Fuel**

A flatbed trailer is useful for transporting containers of fuel such as oil and gas. You can strap the fuel and other important equipment onto the trailer to keep it from tipping. You will have plenty of room on a flatbed, even if you have to work with a team to transport the fuel to job sites.

**9. Oversize Loads**

A trailer is good for transporting oversize loads that would fit poorly in a vehicle. An oversize load might involve a prefabricated home, machine parts or something less typical. With an oversize load, the object you are transporting hangs over the sides of the trailer.

## Safety Precautions for Driving Trailer

1. **Stay Within Your Limits.**

   Review the towing capacity of your specific vehicle and ensure it’s capable of handling the weight of your trailer. Exceeding the maximum towing capacity can result in dangerous handling, insufficient braking performance, or serious damage to the vehicle’s suspension, engine and drivetrain.

2. **Pack your trailer properly**

   Not only is it incredibly important to stay within the trailer’s maximum load capacity, but it’s also important to ensure any cargo is properly positioned.

3. **Check your tires**

   This goes for both your tow vehicle and your trailer. Tires that are not properly inflated can negatively affect handling. Further, underinflated tires can create more rolling resistance, which not only forces the engine to work harder and consume more fuel, but also increases tire temperatures and may contribute to a blow-out.

4. **Check your lights**

   The tail lights and marker lamps on your trailer may seem superfluous, but they’re quite important. Large trailers or loads may obscure the tail lights on your tow vehicle. If the lights on your trailer aren’t illuminated, other drivers may not see your vehicle, especially at night.

5. **Check Your Brakes**

   Smaller, lighter trailers may not need trailer brakes of any kind, but heavier trailers, or those designed to carry heavier loads, will usually incorporate a trailer brake system. Whether your trailer is equipped with hydraulic surge brakes or electric brakes, make sure the emergency “breakaway” cable is properly attached to your tow vehicle.

6. **Adjust Your Mirrors**

   Before taking off, make sure your side view mirrors are adjusted to create a clear view that extends to the end of the trailer. Depending on the vehicle, may offer mirrors specifically designed for towing that extend in order to expand the mirror’s field of vision.

## FAQ

Q: What is the life expectancy of a trailer?

A: That entirely depends on the quality of the trailer, the type of trailer, and how well you maintain it. However, we will say that an average high-quality enclosed trailer will last between 10 and 15 years.

Q: Do trailers hold their value?

A: Trailers, like most vehicles and recreational equipment, typically depreciate in value over time. However, the extent to which a trailer holds its value can vary significantly based on factors like its type, brand, condition, and overall market demand. While most trailers will lose value, some, particularly high-quality or luxury models, may maintain a higher resale value than others.

Q: Do trailers need maintenance?

A: Regular trailer maintenance is critical to ensuring the longevity of your trailer, as well as making sure you are able to tow to your destination safely. Before towing, make sure your trailer and its many components are in safe working order. Worn or broken trailer parts can cause loss of control and injury may result.

Q: How often should I grease my trailer bearings?

A: Trailer wheel bearings should be greased regularly to ensure smooth operation and prevent damage. A general recommendation is to grease them every 10,000 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. If you have a smaller trailer or use it frequently, you may need to grease them more often, possibly every 2,000 miles.

Q: What equipment is required to be on a trailer?

A: Every trailer needs basic equipment for safety and legality, including working lights, reflectors, safety chains, and a properly rated coupler. Trailers weighing 3,000 pounds or more may also require brakes and, in some states, a license plate.
