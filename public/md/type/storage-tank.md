##  Types of Storage Tanks

1. **Internal Floating Roof**

   Internal floating roof storage tank, popularly known as IFR, is employed for liquids having lower melting points like Gasoline and Ethanol. These tanks have a cone shape with a floating roof within, hence its name is floating roof tank. The roof suspended within the storage tank moves along the level of the fluid, i.e., with the increase of the liquid, the roof moves up and with the lowering of the liquid, the roof goes down. If the tank has no liquid, the roof of the tank is held by the legs on which it is placed.

2. **Bullet Tanks**

   Bullet tanks are sphere and flat-shaped industrial storage tanks used mostly in large plants. These types of tanks are usually preferred over the other types to store liquefied gases like Butane and Ammonia for which the melting point is very low. Its name derived from the tank’s long cylindrical form, the tank stores these liquids at a temperature below -148 degrees Fahrenheit.

3. **LNG Storage Tank**

   LNG storage tank or liquefied natural gas storage tank is specially used to store Liquefied Natural Gas. These types of storage tanks in industries are available in LNG carriers, in ground, or above ground. LNG storage tanks have the special characteristic of being able to hold LNG at the extremely low temperature -162 °C.

### Safety Precautions for Storage Tanks

**Proper Labeling and Signage**

Proper labeling and clear signage on storage tanks are crucial for safe operations. Labels should accurately indicate the contents, hazards, and handling instructions of the tank's contents.

**Training and Education for Personnel**

Providing comprehensive training and education to personnel who work with storage tanks is essential. Training should cover topics such as proper handling procedures, emergency response protocols, and the correct use of safety equipment.

**Ensuring Proper Grounding and Bonding**

Proper grounding and bonding are critical safety measures when working with storage tanks containing flammable or combustible substances. Grounding involves connecting the tank to the earth to dissipate static electricity that can accumulate during operations.

**Avoiding Sensitive Environmental Areas**

Positioning storage tanks away from sensitive environmental areas, such as water bodies or ecologically sensitive regions, is a vital safety measure.

**Properly Identifying Stored Substances**

Accurate identification of stored substances is essential for proper handling and emergency response. Using standardized labeling systems, color coding, and specific symbols helps personnel quickly recognize the contents of storage tanks.

**Preventing Contamination and Cross-Reactions**

Separating different substances and preventing cross-contamination within storage tanks ensures chemical stability and safety. Mixing incompatible materials can produce hazardous reactions, releasing toxic fumes or causing fires.

**Monitoring Chemical Reactions and Temperature Variations**

Regularly monitoring the chemical reactions and temperature variations within storage tanks is crucial to detect any abnormal changes.

**Regular Inspections for Signs of Corrosion or Wear**

Frequent inspections of storage tanks for signs of corrosion, wear, or deterioration are essential to prevent leaks, ruptures, or structural failures.

**Monitoring for Leaks, Cracks, or Deformations**

Continuous monitoring for leaks, cracks, or deformations is critical to identify potential failures and prevent hazardous releases promptly.

**Adequate Ventilation and Pressure Relief Systems**

Ensuring proper ventilation and pressure relief systems in storage tanks is essential to prevent pressure buildup, vapor accumulation, or potential explosions.

## FAQ

Q: What are the main types of storage tanks based on shape?

A: The main types are cylindrical, spherical, and rectangular. Cylindrical tanks are common for their stability and space - efficiency. Spherical tanks are good for high - pressure storage due to their uniform stress distribution. Rectangular tanks are used when space layout is a concern.

Q: Why are baffles installed in storage tanks?

A: Baffles are installed to improve mixing, prevent swirling, and enhance the efficiency of heat transfer or chemical reactions. They help in better homogenization of the tank contents and can also reduce the formation of dead zones.

Q: When is stainless steel a preferred material for storage tanks?

A: Stainless steel is preferred when storing substances that are corrosive, require high - purity storage, or need easy cleaning and sanitation. It is widely used in the food and beverage industry (for storing milk, juices, etc.), the pharmaceutical industry (for storing drugs and chemicals), and in some chemical processes where resistance to specific chemicals is required.

Q: What are the considerations for designing the internal structure of a storage tank?

A: Considerations include the type of process occurring in the tank (mixing, reaction, etc.), the properties of the stored material (viscosity, density, etc.), and the need for heat transfer or mass transfer. For example, if the stored liquid is highly viscous, a more powerful agitator and specific baffle design might be needed to ensure proper mixing.

Q: Why are pressure - relief valves important in storage tanks?

A: Pressure - relief valves are important to prevent over - pressurization of the tank. They open when the pressure inside the tank exceeds a certain set limit, which can be due to factors like thermal expansion of the stored material, chemical reactions generating gas, or malfunctioning of other equipment. This helps to protect the tank from rupture and potential leaks, ensuring safety.

Q: How can the safety of a storage tank be ensured?

A: Safety can be ensured by installing proper safety devices such as pressure - relief valves, overflow prevention systems, and leak - detection systems. Regular inspections and maintenance should be carried out to check for any signs of wear, corrosion, or damage. The tank should be designed and installed according to relevant safety standards, and operators should be trained in proper handling and emergency procedures.
