## Advantages of HOWO Tractor Truck

1. **Powerful Performance**

   The Sinotruk HOWO N7 6×4 tractor is usually equipped with the Weichai WP10.5H460E62 engine. This engine has a displacement of 10.5L, a maximum output power of 338kW (460 horsepower), and a maximum torque of 2100N·m. The peak torque can be output within the engine speed range of 1000 - 1400rpm. Such a power configuration enables the vehicle to have abundant power performance whether during starting, acceleration, climbing, high-speed driving, or other working conditions.

2. **Economical and Energy-efficient**

   This model applies many technologies to reduce fuel consumption. Its engine is equipped with technologies such as the re-optimization of the combustion system and high-efficiency pulse supercharging, which makes the fuel burn more completely and effectively improves fuel economy. Relevant data shows that its fuel consumption performance can be 1 - 2L lower than that of competing products. At the same time, some models adopt the design of long oil change intervals and long mileage replacement of filters.

3. **Comfortable and Safe**

   The cab of the Sinotruk HOWO N7 6×4 tractor adopts a large cab design with four-point airbag full floating, which can effectively filter road bumps and provide a stable driving environment for the driver. The standard airbag shock-absorbing seat has multiple functions such as ventilation, heating, seat cushion adjustment, and lumbar support, which can reduce driving fatigue. The interior space of the vehicle is spacious. The width of the sleeper of some models reaches 900mm or even wider.

## Applications of HOWO Tractor Truck

**Long-Haul Logistics**:

The HOWO tractor truck is ideal for long-distance transportation due to its high-speed performance, large fuel tank capacity, and comfortable cab design.

**Heavy Haulage**:

With its strong load-bearing capacity and reliable chassis, it can handle heavy-duty tasks such as coal and sand transportation.

**Urban and Regional Distribution**:

The vehicle’s maneuverability and fuel efficiency make it suitable for urban and regional logistics operations.

## Braking System Types of HOWO Tractor Truck

**ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)**:

The system prevents wheels from locking up during braking, maintaining vehicle stability and control.ABS ensures that the truck can steer safely in emergency braking situations, reducing the risk of skidding.

**Brake Assist (BA)**:

Provides additional braking force during emergency stops.

**EBS (Electronic Braking System)**:

Improves braking response and efficiency by electronically controlling the distribution of braking force.EBS integrates with other electronic systems to provide optimum braking performance and enhance overall safety.

**Hill Start Assist (HSA)**:

Prevents the truck from skidding backward during hill starts, ensuring a smooth and safe start.

## ADAS Functions of HOWO Tractor Truck

1. **Lane Departure Warning (LDW):** Alerts the driver when a vehicle is unintentionally departing from its lane.LDW uses cameras to monitor lane markings and provide an audible or visual alert to the driver.

2. **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB):** Automatically brakes the vehicle when the system detects a risk of a collision ahead.AEB uses a radar and camera system to detect obstacles and activate the brakes when a collision is imminent.

3. **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):** Maintains a safe distance from the vehicle in front by automatically adjusting the truck’s speed.ACC improves driver convenience and safety during long-distance driving.

4. **Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM):** Alerts drivers to vehicles in their blind spots.BSM uses radar sensors to detect vehicles approaching from behind and provides visual or audible alerts.

5. **Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA):** Warns the driver of approaching traffic when reversing.RCTA is useful in busy or congested areas, especially when visibility is restricted.

6. **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA):** Provides steering assistance to help keep the vehicle in the lane.LKA works in conjunction with LDW to enhance lane-keeping performance.
