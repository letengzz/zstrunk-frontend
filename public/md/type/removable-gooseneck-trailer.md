  Types of Removable Gooseneck Trailer

   

  Flatbed trailers

  Flatbed trailers have a flat, level platform without sidewalls or a roof. The open design of flatbed trailers makes them ideal for transporting oversized loads, machinery, construction materials, and other large items that can't fit into enclosed spaces.

  Lowboy trailers

  Lowboy trailers are designed with a very low deck height. They are used to transport tall cargo that can't fit within the standard legal height limit. Lowboy trailers are commonly used to transport construction machinery and equipment.

  ##### Advantages of Removable Gooseneck Trailer

   

  01/

  **Versatility of the Detachable Gooseneck**
  One of the standout features of detachable gooseneck trailers is their versatility. These trailers can be detached from the truck, allowing equipment to be loaded onto the trailer from the front. This feature is particularly advantageous when loading heavy machinery like excavators, bulldozers, or large farm equipment.

  02/

  **Lower Load Height**
  Detachable gooseneck trailers typically have a lower deck height compared to other types of trailers. This lower profile makes them ideal for transporting taller equipment or machinery. By reducing the overall height of the load, these trailers can navigate under bridges and other low-clearance obstacles more easily, expanding the range of routes available for transportation.

  03/

  **Increased Stability**
  The design of gooseneck trailers enhances stability during transport. The gooseneck, which connects the trailer to the truck, provides a stable pivot point, distributing the weight of the load more evenly. This design reduces the risk of trailer sway and improves handling, especially when navigating sharp turns or uneven terrain.

  04/

  **Improved Maneuverability**
  Detachable gooseneck trailers offer excellent maneuverability, particularly in tight spaces or congested work areas. The ability to detach the trailer from the truck allows for easier maneuvering in confined spaces, such as construction sites or loading docks. This feature saves time and reduces the risk of accidents when navigating challenging environments.

  05/

  **Cost Savings**
  While detachable gooseneck trailers may have a higher upfront cost compared to standard trailers, they often provide significant cost savings over time. Their versatility and ability to transport a wide range of equipment make them a valuable investment for businesses that regularly transport heavy loads.

  06/

  **Enhanced Safety**
  Safety is paramount when it comes to transporting heavy equipment. Detachable gooseneck trailers are designed with safety in mind, featuring features such as hydraulic systems for easy loading and unloading, as well as robust construction to withstand heavy loads and rough terrain.

  ## FAQ

   

   

  Q: What is a removable gooseneck trailer?

  A: A removable gooseneck trailer (RGN) is a type of flat - deck trailer with a detachable front section that can be lowered and removed to form a ramp for loading and unloading. It's similar to a lowboy trailer but has the unique removable gooseneck feature.

  Q: How does the removable gooseneck mechanism work?

  A: The gooseneck is typically connected to the main deck via a hydraulic or mechanical mechanism. This allows the front section to be raised and detached from the main trailer, creating a ramp for easy loading and unloading of cargo.

  Q: What is the maximum load weight of a removable gooseneck trailer?

  A: RGN trailers can have up to 20 axles or more to support up to 150,000 pounds of cargo weight. However, before trucking permits are required, the maximum load weight is around 42,000 pounds.

  Q: How do you load and unload cargo on a removable gooseneck trailer?

  A: By detaching the gooseneck, the trailer creates a ramp, allowing self - propelled or wheeled machinery to be driven directly onto the trailer. After loading, the tractor backs up to the trailer and re - attaches the gooseneck.

  Q: What kind of maintenance is required for a removable gooseneck trailer?

  A: Regular inspections of the hydraulic systems (if equipped), brakes, tires, and other components are necessary. The gooseneck attachment mechanism should also be checked for wear and tear to ensure proper functioning.

  Q: What are the characteristics of a removable gooseneck truck?

  A: Detachable Gooseneck Trailers are a popular lowboy trailer. The gooseneck detaches from the main deck allowing operators to drive up the front of the main deck. The removable gooseneck is then reattached for transporting the load. The main deck of these units features front flip ramps or a tapered design.
