  Types of Fence Cargo Trailer

   

  The fence cargo trailers produced by our company mainly include the following types: 

  3 Axle Stake Semi Trailer

  Three-axle drop-side semi-trailers are usually equipped with high-quality axles, boasting a powerful load-bearing capacity. The drop sides are made of high-strength steel with an appropriate thickness. They can not only withstand the heavy pressure of a large amount of goods but also are not prone to deformation or damage during long-term use.

  4 Axle Fence Cargo Truck Trailer

  The four - axle design makes the axle load distribution of the vehicle more reasonable, enabling it to bear a greater weight. Generally, the load capacity can reach around 30 - 40 tons. It is suitable for transporting a large quantity of goods, such as building materials, agricultural products, and industrial products.
