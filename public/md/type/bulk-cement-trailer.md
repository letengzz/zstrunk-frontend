##  Types of Bulk Cement Trailer

The bulk cement trailers produced by our company mainly include the following types:

1. **Single-axle dry bulk cement trailer**

   The single-axle bulk cement trailer has one axle located at the rear section of the trailer. The dry bulk cement trailer is designed with a single axle to offer maneuverability and reduce wear on the tires. The trailers are mostly used for urban environments and short-haul deliveries.

2. **Tandem-axle dry bulk cement trailer**

   The tandem bulk cement trailer has two axles placed side by side. The design of the twin-axle trailers is meant to enhance stability and weight distribution. The trailers are suitable for long-distance transportation of large loads of cement. They are also ideal for transporting cement on smooth and rough terrains.

3. **Tri-axle dry bulk cement trailer**

   The tri-axle trailers are designed with three axles placed in a row. The three axles of the trailers offer increased load capacity and strength. The tri-axle trailers are designed for heavy-duty applications such as transporting bulk cement. The trailers are also ideal for high-speed operations and long-distance transportation.

## Precautions for Safe Use of Bulk Cement Trailers

1. If the cement bulker has not been used for a long time, when restarting, the air compressor should be started first and blow 2-3 times. After the experiment is correct, make a record and then load the cement.
2. It is strictly forbidden to open the inlet cover when there is air pressure in the tank. The air release valve must be opened first. The pressure indication value is zero to confirm. Only when there is no air released from the air outlet pipe, the inlet cover can be opened.
3. When unloading the cement to a common warehouse on the ground (there is no joint), the pressure needs to be slightly lower when opening the discharge valve.
4. The use of brakes is strictly prohibited to increase the loading capacity.
5. When loading, the feeding port should be equipped with a filter to prevent agglomerated cement, paper bags, cotton yarn, etc. from entering the tank, which may bring difficulties to unloading.
6. Check the air compressor frequently in case there is any leakage of lubricating oil. It should be replenished in time to avoid damage to the compressor.
7. When unloading the cement, the operator should pay attention to the pressure gauge. It should be no higher than the specified value (0.2mpa).
8. When unloading, unrelated people are forbidden to stand around the cement bulker.
9. The pipes and fittings should be jointed well.
