## Advantages of Engine

**Best-in-class fuel efficiency that lowers costs**

Diesel-run engines are designed to have a higher compression ratio than gasoline engines. The fuel-air mixture is compressed more before ignition, which makes combustion a much faster process in these engines. Unlike gasoline, diesel burns at a slower rate, which further makes these engines fuel-efficient.

**Seamless integration of technology to monitor engine health**

Engines by Weichai are full-authority electronic control engines. This means they provide built-in diagnostics and alerts that promptly identify and address any issues, thus improving safety and reducing maintenance costs for the end users.

**Outstanding power-to-weight ratio for enhanced durability**

As a business owner, you look for engines that are not only efficient but also have a longer lifespan even under intense application. And that is what these engines are designed for! Designed to suit extreme-duty cycles, diesel-run engines by Weichai are best suited to carry out rigorous tasks in extreme conditions.

**Extended maintenance intervals that reduce ownership costs**

Both diesel and gasoline engines require maintenance from time to time. Yet, you will spend much lower time and money on maintenance sessions with our diesel-run engines. With the simple build design and excellent capability of functioning in harsh conditions, these engines do not require frequent upkeeps.

**Mounted with After Treatment system to cut down emissions**

Engines by Weichai are designed while conforming to emission standards. With the aim to contribute to a cleaner future, our engines are mounted with after-treatment systems that filter the fuel exhausts. Besides, these mechanisms are integrated while ensuring a compact layout.

## Applications of Engine

1. **Marine Vessels**:

   These engines power high-speed boats, passenger ships, and fishing boats. They are also used in inland and offshore water transportation, providing reliable performance in tough maritime conditions.

2. **Trucks and Land Use**:

Engines are found in heavy-duty trucks used for construction and logistics. Their powerful performance is ideal for these demanding tasks.

3. **Emergency and Standby Units**:

   Weichai engines are used as emergency and standby units in industrial and marine settings, offering backup power when needed.

## FAQ

Q: What is the fuel consumption of Weichai engine?

A: Minimum fuel consumption low to 188g/kW·h.

Q: Which trucks use a Weichai engine?

A: 1.Tractor truck.
2.Medium and heavy duty freight truck.
3.Medium and heavy dump truck.
4.Light duty freight truck.
5.Light duty dump truck.
6.Medium and heavy duty special vehicle.
7.Light duty special vehicle.

Q: At what speed is a diesel engine most efficient?

A: It is likely to be geared for 2500 rpm or so at that speed, yet for maximum efficiency the engine should be running at about 1500 rpm (gasoline) or 1200 rpm (diesel) to generate that power as efficiently as possible for that engine (although the actual figures will vary by engine and vehicle).

Q: How does Weichai engine ensure reliability?

A: The crankshaft is made of high - strength ductile iron and treated by nitriding, and the cylinder liner is made of boron - alloy cast iron with the inner surface honed by the platform mesh - hole process, which has high strength, low wear, and long service life.

Q: How often does the Weichai engine need maintenance?

A: The oil and filter should be replaced every 5000 kilometers, the fuel system should be cleaned every 20,000 kilometers, the intake system should be cleaned every 10,000 kilometers, and the valve clearance should be checked and adjusted every 20,000 kilometers, etc.

Q: How to troubleshoot the problem that the Weichai engine cannot start?

A: Check the battery power, fuel filter, spark plugs, and other components. It may also be due to fuel system, ignition system, or engine mechanical faults. Replace the faulty components if necessary.
