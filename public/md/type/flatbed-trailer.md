## Types of Flatbed Trailer

The flatbed trailers produced by our company mainly include the following types:

**Standard Flatbed**

A standard flatbed is the most common type, often used for hauling cargo such as machinery and lumber. This option is favored across the country for open-deck freight. It has no frills attached and provides several transportation options for many applications.

**Lowboy Trailer**

Lowboy flatbeds have a lowered bed in front of the rear axles, allowing for the transportation of tall and heavy loads such as machinery and construction equipment. They commonly sit lower than standard trailers and have two drops in height to accommodate cargo too tall for standard trailers.

**Removable Gooseneck**

As the name suggests, the removable gooseneck (RGN) has a removable gooseneck and a drop deck, making them versatile options for long and tall loads, such as construction equipment and machinery.

**Drop Deck**

Drop deck trailers — also known as step decks — have a top and bottom deck, and are often used to transport cargo that’s too wide or tall for other flatbed options. It has a bed design featuring a deck that drops lower than standard flatbeds to accommodate elevated loads under height restrictions.

## Benefits Of Flatbed Trailers

1. **Convenient Loading and Unloading**

   Because flatbed trailers have no sides, doors or roofs, they can load and unload cargo from any angle. Loading and unloading of cargo is convenient, whether by crane or by hand.

2. **Huge Storage Space and Efficient Delivery Times**

   One of the biggest advantages of a flatbed trailer is its large storage space. Its space allows you to load as much as possible, thus allowing you to spend less time on multiple transportations.

3. **Flexible Hauling Options**

   Different types of flatbed trailers have their own unique features that allow drivers to transport different types of cargo.

4. **Easy Cleaning and Low Maintenance**

   The open deck feature of flatbed trailers makes them easier to maintain and clean. You can also avoid repainting sidewalls when objects leave severe dents or scratches.

## Applications of Flatbed Trailer

**Construction Equipment Transport**

Flatbed trailers stand out for their ability to transport heavy construction equipment such as bulldozers, cranes, and excavators. The open platform design is perfect for accommodating oversized machinery that wouldn’t fit inside enclosed trailers.

**Agricultural Machinery Hauling**

Flatbed trailers play an essential role in agriculture by transporting large machinery such as tractors and harvesters. Their design facilitates the easy loading of bulky and irregularly shaped equipment, which is especially critical during peak farming periods.

**Transporting Building Materials**
The construction industry relies heavily on flatbed trailers for moving bulky building materials like steel beams, lumber, and concrete blocks. Their ability to carry long or irregularly shaped items makes them indispensable for delivering essential supplies.

**Moving Prefabricated Structures**

Flatbed trailers offer an effective solution for transporting prefabricated structures, including modular homes and portable office units. The flat surface accommodates large, pre-assembled components that need to arrive intact at their final destination.

**Shipping Industrial Machinery**

Industries often need to transport complex machinery such as generators, turbines, and presses between locations or directly to customers. Flatbed trailers are ideal for this purpose, as they offer the capacity and flexibility required for large equipment.

**Transporting Oversized Loads**

Flatbed trailers are indispensable tools for moving oversized loads, such as wind turbine blades and large tanks, that exceed standard trailer dimensions. Their open design can accommodate unusual shapes and sizes, while specialized equipment like extendable flatbeds enhances their capability.

**Hauling Scrap and Waste**

Recycling and waste management companies frequently use flatbed trailers to haul scrap metal, demolition debris, and other bulky waste materials. The sturdy design supports heavy and uneven loads, while the open structure facilitates easy dumping and unloading.

**Transporting Vehicles**

Flatbed trailers are a popular choice for car dealerships, manufacturers, and auction houses needing to transport multiple vehicles at once. They offer the flexibility to carry cars, trucks, and motorcycles securely and efficiently between locations.

**Delivering Large Retail Goods**

Retailers handling large or bulky items like furniture and appliances often depend on flatbed trailers for delivery. The open design accommodates oversized products that might not fit in conventional delivery vehicles.

## Considerations of Using a Flatbed Trailer

1. **Load Securing and Tie-Downs**

   As you can imagine, especially because this trailer type is open on all sides, it’s super important to safely secure and tie down cargo on a Flatbed. This is properly done by utilizing tie-downs, straps, chains and other safety securing equipment to ensure there’s no shifting of the freight while in transit to keep it from becoming damaged.

2. **Legal Compliance**

   This is a HUGE consideration, although we have said about how great Flatbeds are for transporting oversized and over-dimensional cargo. There are strict local laws and regulations around transporting these types of freight. It’s important to ensure the cargo load complies with weight restrictions, height restrictions, permits and other legal requirements.

3. **Weight Distribution**

   Flatbed are super stable trailer types. However, it’s important to distribute cargo evenly to spread the load. This helps to maintain stability and safety on the road when in transit and avoids overloading one area.

4. **Weather Conditions**

   As Flatbeds are entirely open, any cargo being hauled on one of these trailers needs to be hardy and not affected by any sort of weather condition, whether it’s by the sun and heat, or cold and rain or snow. If a shipment has a delicate item that absolutely cannot be caught out in the rain for example. This would effect shipping times or another trailers might be a better option.
