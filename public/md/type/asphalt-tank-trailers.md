##  Types of Asphalt Tank Trailers

The asphalt tank trailers produced by our company mainly include the following types: 

**Emulsion Tanker Trailer**

An emulsion tanker trailer transports asphalt emulsions, which are emulsions of asphalt, water, and additives. These trailers have specialized agitation and pumping systems to maintain the emulsion's stability during transport.

**Cold Mix Asphalt Trailer**

Cold mix asphalt trailers carry a pre-mixed asphalt aggregate blend at ambient temperatures. These trailers do not require heating systems but are designed to ensure the mix's quality during transport.

## Characteristics of Asphalt Tank Trailers

1. **Efficient Transportation**

   The large - capacity tank allows for the transportation of a large quantity of asphalt in one go, which is highly beneficial for large - scale construction projects that require a continuous supply of asphalt. This reduces the number of trips needed, saving both time and fuel.

2. **Quality Maintenance**

   The heating and insulation systems work together to maintain the asphalt's temperature and fluidity, ensuring that the asphalt arrives at the construction site in the same quality as when it was loaded. This is crucial for ensuring the quality of the asphalt pavement.

3. **Safety Features**

   These trailers are equipped with various safety devices, such as explosion - proof valves, pressure - relief valves, and grounding wires. These features help to prevent accidents such as leaks, explosions, and fires, ensuring the safety of the transportation process.

4. **Environmental Friendliness**

   The good sealing performance of the tank prevents asphalt leakage, which helps to protect the environment from pollution. Additionally, the efficient heating and insulation systems reduce energy consumption, making it an environmentally friendly option.

## Asphalt Tank Trailer Materials

**Stainless Steel**

Stainless steel is a popular choice for asphalt tank trailers due to its exceptional heat resistance and corrosion resistance, which are crucial for maintaining the asphalt's temperature and preventing damage from the hot material.

**Aluminum**

Aluminum is often used for its lightweight nature, which allows the trailer to haul more asphalt while still adhering to weight regulations. Aluminum trailers also offer good durability and are suitable for long-distance hauling.

## Precautions for Loading and Unloading Asphalt Tank Trailers

1. **Loading**

● Ensuring that the chain covers are in the right places on the rotating drives so there is no chance of entanglement.
● The combustion sources are well-lit and nowhere near open manholes or overflow vents. This ensures there are no fire hazards.
● The distributor motor is on before the value is opened.
● Before opening the storage tank, the loading hose must be attached properly and the bleeder valve should be closed.
● Ensure that no one is standing close to the valves, which may open. This is an added safety measure.
● Once everything is in place, open the valve on the storage tank and pump the desired amount of asphalt at a slow rate. This rate should be appropriate, neither too high nor too low.
● Once the asphalt fills the tank, the storage valve and the bleeder valve are closed. The pump must continue to work so that all asphalt residue is out of the hose.
● The tank must have enough space for the expansion of the asphalt when it is heated.
● Once the hose clears all asphalt residue, it is disconnected and stored properly. The bleeder valve is closed and locked.
● The asphalt levels on the tank and gauges must also be checked to ensure sufficient quantity is loaded in the tank.

2. **Unloading**

● Checking whether the storage tank has sufficient capacity.
● The unloading pipe is attached to the truck, and the bleeder valve is closed. Once this is in place, the operator will unlock the storage tank.
● The valve of the storage tank pump is opened and the desired amount is filled at the right rate.
● Once the unloading is completed, the distributor adjustments are made following the operations manual, and the valve is closed.
● Every operator must follow the unloading instructions according to the model of the sucking pipe. The pipe must be cleared of any asphalt residue by the bleeder valve.
● Once all the steps are finished properly, the pipe should be disconnected from the distributor and placed back in its storage place. The valve on the tank must be locked and the bleeder valve closed.

## FAQ

Q: How is an asphalt tank trailer different from a regular fuel tank trailer?

A: Asphalt tank trailers are designed to handle the high viscosity and specific temperature requirements of asphalt. They usually have heating and insulation systems, while regular fuel tank trailers are mainly for transporting lower - viscosity fuels and do not typically have such extensive heating and insulation features.

Q: Why are asphalt tank trailers often made of certain materials like carbon steel or stainless steel?

A: Carbon steel is used for its high strength and relatively low cost, making it suitable for general - purpose asphalt transportation. Stainless steel is chosen for its excellent corrosion resistance, which is beneficial when transporting modified asphalt or other asphalt mixtures that may be more corrosive.

Q: What types of heating systems are commonly used in asphalt tank trailers?

A: Common heating systems include diesel burners, electric heating, and hot oil heating systems. Diesel burner heating has high efficiency and low cost, electric heating is clean and easy to control, and hot oil heating has good uniformity and safety.

Q: How do you maintain the axle and suspension of an asphalt tank trailer?

A: Regularly check the axle for signs of wear, such as uneven tire wear or axle misalignment. Lubricate the suspension components according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Inspect the air - bags (if using air suspension) for any leaks or damage and replace worn - out leaf springs as needed.

Q: What are the differences between bottom - discharge and side - discharge asphalt tank trailers?

A: Bottom - discharge trailers are more common as they allow for more efficient unloading due to gravity, and it's easier to control the discharge rate. Side - discharge trailers are suitable for special working conditions, such as unloading in narrow spaces where bottom - discharge may not be practical.

Q: What is the typical pumping capacity of an asphalt tank trailer's pumping system?

A: The pumping capacity can vary depending on the size and type of the trailer and the specific requirements of the transportation task. Generally, it can range from several cubic meters per hour to tens of cubic meters per hour. For example, a medium - sized asphalt tank trailer may have a pumping capacity of 10 - 20 cubic meters per hour.
