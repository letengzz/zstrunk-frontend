## Product Description

### Ffficient Loading, Unloading and Powerful Dumping Capacity

1. **Rapid Self-unloading**: The two-axle tipping drawbar trailer is equipped with an advanced hydraulic self-unloading system, which can complete the unloading of goods in a short time, greatly improving the loading and unloading efficiency. Compared with traditional manual unloading or non-self-unloading trailers, it can save a large amount of time and labor costs. For example, when transporting construction materials such as sand and soil on a construction site, it can quickly dump the goods at the designated location, accelerating the progress of the project.
2. **Large Tipping Angle**: The self-unloading angle of the trailer is usually carefully designed and can reach a relatively large tilting angle to ensure that the goods can be completely unloaded without any residue. For some materials with high viscosity, such as wet soil, the large tipping angle can effectively solve the unloading problem and ensure the smooth progress of transportation work.

### Flexible Maneuverability and Good Passability

1. **Flexible Two-axle Design**: The two-axle layout gives the trailer excellent flexibility during driving. It has a relatively small turning radius and can easily turn and make U-turns in narrow construction sites, rural roads or urban streets, adapting to complex road environments. Whether it is in urban construction projects with limited space or in remote areas with complex terrains, it can pass smoothly.
2. **High Ground Clearance**: To cope with various road conditions, the trailer has a high ground clearance and can easily cross road obstacles such as potholes and bumps, reducing the risk of scraping the vehicle's chassis. This feature enables it to maintain good passability on unpaved roads, muddy roads and other adverse road conditions, expanding the scope of its operation.

### Reliable Load-bearing Capacity and Robust and Durable Structure

- **Reasonable Load-bearing Design**: According to the load-bearing capacity of the two axles, the trailer's carriage and frame have been optimized in design, with reliable load-bearing performance. It can safely and stably transport various heavy-duty goods, such as bricks and steel, meeting the transportation needs of different industries. At the same time, through scientific structural design, it ensures that the weight of the goods is evenly distributed on the two axles, improving driving stability.
- **Sturdy Body Material**: The whole vehicle is made of high-strength steel, and the carriage and frame have good compression resistance and anti-deformation ability. They can withstand frequent loading and unloading operations and the test of harsh road conditions, extending the service life of the trailer. Even if it operates in a heavy-load and bumpy working environment for a long time, it is not easy to have structural damage, reducing the maintenance cost and providing users with a long-term reliable transportation tool.
