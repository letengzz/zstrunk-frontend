## Carbon Steel Tanker Trailer Product Description

**1. Precise Measurement and Monitoring**

It is equipped with a high-precision liquid level measurement system and advanced monitoring equipment, which can accurately display parameters such as the liquid level, temperature, and density of the oil products in the tank in real time, allowing operators to accurately grasp the storage and transportation status of the oil products. At the same time, through remote monitoring technology, customers can obtain real-time information about the location, driving status, and oil product information of the oil tank trailer in the office or other locations, which is convenient for dispatching management and safety monitoring, and effectively avoids oil product losses and potential safety hazards during transportation.

**2. Rapid Conversion and Multi-purpose Use**

It adopts a unique quick-connect joint and a detachable internal structure design, enabling the oil tank trailer to complete the conversion operation of different oil products within a short period of time, such as switching from transporting gasoline to transporting diesel. This design not only improves the vehicle's utilization efficiency but also reduces the cost for customers to purchase multiple specialized oil tank trucks. In addition, this oil tank trailer can also be used to transport some other liquid goods with similar properties, such as chemical raw materials, through simple modification, and has strong multi-purpose functionality, providing convenience for customers to expand their business scope.

**3. Low Center of Gravity and Stability**

The design of the oil tank adopts a low center of gravity structure, reducing the center of gravity of the tank body, which effectively improves the stability and safety of the vehicle during driving. Especially when driving at high speeds, turning, or encountering emergency situations, the low center of gravity design can reduce the risk of the vehicle rolling over and ensure transportation safety. At the same time, with a high-performance suspension system and tires, it can better adapt to different road conditions, reducing the impact of bumps on the tank body and oil products, and further improving the smoothness of transportation.

**4. Environmental Protection and Energy-saving Design**

In terms of environmental protection, the oil tank trailer is equipped with an advanced oil and gas recovery system, which can effectively collect the volatilized oil and gas during the oil loading and unloading process, preventing the oil and gas from being discharged into the atmosphere and causing pollution, meeting strict environmental protection standards. In terms of energy conservation, the vehicle's engine adopts high-efficiency and energy-saving technology, optimizing the combustion process and reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. In addition, the overall appearance design of the vehicle also takes aerodynamic factors into account, further reducing wind resistance, improving fuel economy, reducing operating costs, and contributing to environmental protection.

## **Maintenance Protocols for Longevity**

To ensure optimal performance and regulatory compliance, follow these maintenance guidelines:

Weekly Checks

- **Valve Integrity Test:** Inspect API pneumatic valves for leaks using bubble solution.
- **Vapor Recovery System:** Verify pressure levels (maintain 2-3 psi).
- **Structural Inspection:** Use ultrasonic thickness gauges to measure:

Tank shell: ≥4.8mm

End plates: ≥5.5mm

Monthly Procedures

- **Baffle Alignment:** Confirm 7-layer baffle spacing at 1,200mm intervals
- **Suspension Lubrication:** Apply NLGI #2 grease to mechanical components
- **Brake System Audit:** Check WABCO relay valves and adjust slack adjusters to 0.5-1mm play

Annual Overhaul

- **Hydrostatic Testing:** Pressurize to 1.5x working pressure (4.5 bar) for 30 minutes
- **Coating Renewal:** Reapply polyurethane paint (dry film thickness ≥120μm)
- **Certification Renewal:** Schedule SASO/ADR compliance recertification

  Real-time load distribution

  Valve actuation cycles

Corrosion hotspots via embedded sensors
