## Asphalt Tanker Trailer Product Description

### Tank Material and Design Facilitate Cleaning

- The tanks of liquid asphalt tank trailers are usually made of stainless steel or carbon steel lined with a special anti-corrosion coating. The stainless steel material has a smooth surface, making it difficult for asphalt to adhere to it. Moreover, it has strong corrosion resistance, is not prone to rust, and is not easily eroded by the components in asphalt, which makes it easy to clean. Even if there is a small amount of asphalt residue, it can be removed through simple flushing and wiping.
- The internal design of the tank is relatively simple, without complex structures or dead corners. For example, the inner wall of the tank is smooth, and the welds are flat, reducing the areas where asphalt can accumulate. At the same time, the bottom of the tank is usually designed to be inclined, which is convenient for the asphalt to flow out as much as possible after unloading, reducing the residue and providing convenience for subsequent cleaning work.

### Equipped with Professional Cleaning Equipment and Systems

- This type of trailer is generally equipped with a special cleaning device, such as a built-in cleaning spray head. During cleaning, by spraying high-pressure hot water or steam into the tank, the asphalt adhering to the tank wall can be effectively melted and washed away. The spraying angle and intensity of the hot water or steam are carefully designed to cover all parts of the tank, ensuring comprehensive and blind spot - free cleaning.
- Some high-end liquid asphalt tank trailers are also equipped with an automatic cleaning system. This system can automatically complete the cleaning process according to the set program, including steps such as water injection, heating, spraying, and circulation. Operators only need to set the parameters on the console, and the system can run automatically. This not only improves the cleaning efficiency but also reduces the workload of manual operation and cleaning costs.

### Recovery and Treatment of Asphalt after Cleaning

- When cleaning liquid asphalt tank trailers, the sewage containing asphalt generated will be collected into the sewage tank through a special recovery pipeline. Then, through processes such as filtration and sedimentation, the asphalt particles in the sewage are separated to achieve the recovery and reuse of asphalt. This not only reduces the waste of asphalt and lowers operating costs but also avoids environmental pollution caused by asphalt.
- For the cleaned water after the asphalt is separated, it can be used again for cleaning the tank after being purified and meeting the standards, realizing the recycling of water resources and demonstrating good environmental benefits and cleaning advantages.
