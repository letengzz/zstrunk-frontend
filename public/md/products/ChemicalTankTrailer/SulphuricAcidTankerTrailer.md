## Sulphuric Acid Tanker Trailer Product Description

Sulfuric acid tank trailers are specialized vehicles designed for the transportation of sulfuric acid. Here is an introduction to them:

### Structural Design

- **Tank Body**: Usually made of carbon steel with a thickness of 6 - 8mm. Materials like steel - lined plastic and stainless steel are also used to enhance corrosion resistance. The thickness of the head is generally greater than that of the tank body. To reduce the sloshing of sulfuric acid during transportation, several anti - slosh baffles are installed inside the tank.
- **Safety Accessories**: There are full - plastic breather valves, vacuum valves, and spare ports for safety valves on the top of the tank. At the rear, there is a DN100 lined submarine valve, and on the left and right, there are DN80 lined outlets. It is also equipped with a folding lift guardrail, a rear ladder, a toolbox, and a spare tire rack.
- **Chassis**: The frame is made of high - strength steel and equipped with high - performance axles, suspension systems, and tires to ensure the vehicle's load - bearing capacity and driving stability. It is also equipped with safety devices such as a braking system and an anti - lock braking system (ABS).

### Performance Parameters

- **Volume**: The volume of common sulfuric acid tank trailers is about 20 - 30 cubic meters. There are also models with larger or smaller volumes to meet different transportation needs.
- **Load Capacity**: It varies according to the volume and vehicle type, generally around 20 - 30 tons.
- **Pressure Rating**: The pressure rating of the tank of sulfuric acid tank trailers is generally low - pressure. The design pressure is usually between 0.1 - 1.6MPa.

### Transportation Safety Measures

- **Personnel Requirements**: Drivers and escorts must receive professional training, understand the properties, hazard characteristics, and emergency measures of sulfuric acid, and be qualified through assessment before taking up their posts.
- **Driving Requirements**: During transportation, avoid densely populated areas, schools, hospitals, and other places. Choose flat, wide, and well - conditioned roads to drive on. Strictly control the driving speed and avoid sudden braking, sharp turns, and other operations.
- **Emergency Handling**: The vehicle is equipped with emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers, protective gear, and emergency rescue tools. In the event of a leak or other accidents, immediately evacuate the surrounding people and take corresponding emergency measures.

### Maintenance and Repair

- **Regular Inspection**: Regularly conduct a comprehensive inspection of the vehicle, including the tank body, valves, pipes, safety accessories, etc., and promptly detect and handle problems such as wear, corrosion, and leakage.
- **Tank Cleaning**: Regularly clean the inside and outside of the tank to prevent sulfuric acid residue from corroding the tank body and keep the appearance of the tank clean.
- **Replacement of Vulnerable Parts**: According to the vehicle's usage and the manufacturer's recommendations, promptly replace vulnerable parts such as tires, brake pads, and seals to ensure the vehicle's performance and safety.
