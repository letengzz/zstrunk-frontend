## Van and Curtain Trailer Product Description

**1. Efficient Loading and Unloading, Improving Turnover**：The side curtain design greatly facilitates the loading and unloading of goods. The side curtain can be quickly rolled up. When loading and unloading goods, equipment such as forklifts and pallet trucks can enter and exit unobstructed from the side. Compared with traditional enclosed trailers that can only be loaded and unloaded from the rear, the efficiency is significantly improved. In scenarios such as logistics warehouses where goods are frequently loaded and unloaded, it can remarkably shorten the loading and unloading time and accelerate the turnover speed of vehicles. This enables your transportation business to complete more orders within a unit of time, improving the overall operation efficiency and reducing logistics costs.

**2. Flexible Space Utilization, Adaptable to Diverse Goods**：The interior space of the carriage is open and regular, without too many internal structural obstructions. The layout can be flexibly adjusted according to the shape and size of the goods. Whether it is large mechanical equipment, bundled pipes, or pallet goods of various specifications, they can all be easily loaded. During transportation, the side curtain can ensure the safety of the goods while not restricting the placement of the goods like traditional stakes. It can make full use of every inch of the space in the carriage, increasing the cargo loading capacity and meeting the transportation needs of different types of goods in various industries.

**3. Good Ventilation and Visibility, Ensuring Cargo Safety**：The side curtain is not completely enclosed, and good air convection can be formed during driving. For some goods that have requirements for ventilation, such as fruits, vegetables, and chemicals that need to dissipate odors, it can effectively prevent the goods from deteriorating due to stuffiness and humidity. At the same time, the driver can directly observe the status of the goods in the carriage through the side curtain, and promptly detect abnormal situations such as whether the goods have shifted or fallen. This enhances the safety and controllability during transportation, reduces the risk of cargo transportation, and safeguards your goods.
