## Product Description

The stability of low - bed semi - trailers during transportation is ensured through several design features and safety measures, including a low center of gravity, a robust suspension system, anti - skid devices, and advanced braking systems. Here's a detailed explanation:

**Low Center of Gravity Design**

- The deck of low - bed semi - trailers is designed to be close to the ground, typically 800 - 1000 mm from the ground. This significantly lowers the center of gravity of the trailer and the cargo it carries. When the center of gravity is low, the risk of the trailer tipping over during turns, sudden maneuvers, or when driving on uneven roads is greatly reduced.

**Robust Suspension System**

- **Leaf Spring Suspension**: Many low - bed semi - trailers are equipped with leaf spring suspension systems. These systems consist of multiple layers of curved metal springs that are connected to the trailer's axle and frame. Leaf springs help to evenly distribute the load of the cargo across the axles, reducing the impact of bumps and vibrations on the trailer's stability. They also provide some flexibility, allowing the wheels to move independently to a certain extent, which helps the trailer maintain better contact with the road surface.
- **Air Suspension**: Some higher - end low - bed semi - trailers use air suspension systems. Air - filled rubber bags are used instead of traditional springs. Air suspension offers several advantages for stability. It can automatically adjust the height of the trailer based on the load, keeping the deck at a consistent level. This is particularly useful when the load on the trailer changes during transportation. Additionally, air suspension provides better shock absorption, reducing the bouncing and swaying of the trailer, which improves overall stability.
- **Anti - Skid Devices**
- The surface of the trailer deck is often made of anti - skid materials or has anti - skid patterns. This ensures that the equipment or cargo loaded on the trailer does not slide during transportation, especially when the trailer is accelerating, braking, or turning. Some trailers may also be equipped with tie - down points and straps to secure the cargo firmly in place, further enhancing stability.

**Advanced Braking Systems**

- **Drum Brakes**: Many low - bed semi - trailers are equipped with drum brakes. These brakes work by using a set of brake shoes that expand against the inner surface of a rotating drum attached to the axle. Drum brakes are reliable and provide good stopping power, helping to ensure the trailer can be brought to a stop safely without skidding or losing stability.
- **Disc Brakes**: In some cases, disc brakes are used, especially on larger or more specialized low - bed semi - trailers. Disc brakes use a caliper that squeezes a brake pad against a rotating disc. They offer better heat dissipation and more consistent braking performance than drum brakes, which is important for maintaining stability during emergency stops or when descending long slopes.
- **Anti - lock Braking System (ABS)**: Most modern low - bed semi - trailers are equipped with ABS. This system prevents the wheels from locking up during braking, allowing the driver to maintain steering control and preventing the trailer from skidding or jackknifing. ABS is particularly effective in wet or slippery road conditions, significantly enhancing the stability and safety of the trailer during transportation.
