## Product Description

### Flexible Compartment Structure Design

The interior of the compartment can adopt adjustable partitions or movable side panel designs. When transporting different types of goods, the internal space layout of the compartment can be flexibly adjusted according to the shape, size, and characteristics of the goods. For example, when transporting large goods with irregular shapes, the partitions can be removed or moved to form a complete large space in the compartment. When transporting various small goods of different specifications, the partitions can be used to divide the compartment into multiple small areas, enabling classified loading and improving space utilization and the safety of goods transportation.

### Advanced Suspension System

It is equipped with an air suspension or an oil-gas suspension system. This kind of suspension system can automatically adjust the stiffness and height of the suspension according to the vehicle's load, ensuring that the vehicle maintains good driving stability and comfort under different load conditions. When the vehicle is unloaded, the suspension system can appropriately raise the vehicle body, reducing tire wear and ground resistance and improving fuel economy. When the vehicle is fully loaded, the suspension system can effectively cushion the bumps and vibrations of the road surface, protecting the goods and the vehicle structure. At the same time, it also reduces the driver's fatigue and improves driving safety.

### Efficient Unloading Auxiliary Devices

In addition to the conventional hydraulic self-unloading system, some unloading auxiliary devices may also be equipped, such as a vibrator at the bottom of the compartment or a pushing plate device. The vibrator can vibrate the compartment during unloading, making it easier for the goods to slide out of the compartment. Especially for some goods with high viscosity or those prone to piling up, such as wet soil and coal cinder, it can effectively prevent the goods from sticking to the bottom of the compartment and improve the unloading efficiency. The pushing plate device can push the goods from the front of the compartment to the back, achieving more thorough unloading, which is particularly suitable for some occasions where the goods need to be unloaded more cleanly, such as waste treatment plants and bulk material warehouses.

### Personalized Appearance Design

On the basis of meeting the vehicle's functional and safety requirements, attention is paid to the personalization and aesthetics of the appearance design. The vehicle can adopt unique color combinations, streamlined body lines, or eye-catching logos, which not only enhance the overall image of the vehicle but also make it stand out among numerous transport vehicles and enhance brand recognition. For some users engaged in high-end logistics or special industries, the personalized appearance design can reflect the professional image and brand value of the enterprise, helping to enhance the enterprise's market competitiveness.

### Application of Environmental Protection and Energy Conservation Technologies

Some environmental protection and energy conservation technologies are adopted, such as the engine's exhaust gas purification device and the intelligent fuel-saving system. The exhaust gas purification device can effectively reduce the emission of harmful substances in the vehicle's exhaust gas, comply with national environmental protection standards, and reduce environmental pollution. The intelligent fuel-saving system can automatically optimize the engine's fuel injection volume and operating parameters according to the vehicle's driving status, road conditions, and load information, achieving the effect of energy conservation and emission reduction. In addition, the vehicle's tires may also use environmentally friendly tires with low rolling resistance, further reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
