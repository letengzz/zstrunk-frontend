## Side wall Tipper Product Description

Side - wall dump trucks are a type of specialized vehicle designed for efficient unloading of bulk materials. Here is an introduction to them:

**1. Higher Loading Limit**：Compared with common-sized stake trailers, the 40-foot length provides a significantly larger loading area and space, and its cargo capacity usually far exceeds that of ordinary specifications. When transporting large mechanical equipment and a large number of boxed goods, it can carry more at one time, reducing the frequency of transportation. For the transportation of materials for large projects or large-scale logistics distribution, it can greatly improve efficiency and reduce costs. In contrast, ordinary trailers need to make multiple round trips to complete the same transportation volume.

**2.Suitable for Special Cargo Transportation**：Its extra-long size is particularly suitable for transporting some special goods that are extra-long and extra-wide, such as large steel beams and customized building components. Ordinary stake trailers are difficult to transport such goods due to size limitations. However, with its own space advantage, the 40-foot stake trailer can safely and stably transport these special goods to the destination through reasonable planning of the loading layout, expanding the scope of transportation business.

**3. Optimized Structural Strength**：In order to bear a greater weight and adapt to long-distance transportation, the 40-foot stake trailer has been strengthened in the structural design of the frame, stakes, etc. Thicker steel materials and stronger welding processes are used to ensure that the vehicle body structure remains stable when fully loaded, driving at high speed, or passing through bumpy roads, reducing the risk of damage to the goods caused by vehicle vibration and deformation. Compared with ordinary stake trailers, it can provide more reliable transportation protection for valuable or fragile goods.
